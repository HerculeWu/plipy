Here we discuss an optimizing compiler for our Cuppa1 language.  The source language for our compiler is the Cuppa1 language and the target language is our Exp1bytecode.

If the condition ever evaluates to zero then the `jumpF` instruction will transfer control to the `Lbottom` label. That is, if the condition evaluates to zero then we skip the loop body and continue executing the statement after the loop.

The same thing is true for Exp1bycode patterns generated from Cuppa1 expressions: Any Exp1bytecode pattern generated from a Cuppa1 expression should be composable with any other Exp1bytecode pattern due to a Cuppa1 expression and alway give rise to valid Exp1bytecode expressions.\n",

The function walks the two children which in turn generates an expression string for each child and then synthesizes a string the represents the current binary operation.  This string is the return value of this node function.  The node function of `id_exp`, that is variable names that appear in expressions, returns the name of the variable and the node function of `integer_exp` return the value of the integers as a string.  In this way we can explain the expression string `'(+ x 1)'` that appears in the `store` instruction in our generated list of instructions.\n",

In order to accomplish this we need to walk the AST for a Cuppa1 program and look for patterns that allow us to rewrite the tree.

That is exactly what happens in the examples above.  A label references to `L15` are rewritten as label references to `L16` and the label definition of `L15` is deleted from the code together with its `noop` instruction.  Now it might dawn you on why our codegenerator generates code as a list of instructions because a list of instructions is easy to rewrite."
