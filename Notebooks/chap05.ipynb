    "In this chapter we continue our discussion of IR design.  We introduce the idea of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) as an IR which is well suited for more complex languages.  We show that this intermediate representation can be directly derived from the grammar itself which facilitates the IR design. We illustrate these ideas with a pretty printer program that processes a simple language called Cuppa1.  This example also illustrates a nice way to process abstract syntax trees via something called *tree walking*.  We finish the chapter by designing a tree walker which is an interpreter for our Cuppa1 language."

We need to tell the parser generator about the precendence and associativity of each arithmetic opertor so that the expressions are parsed correctly.  Consider the expression `3 * 4 + 1`.  Without the precedence and associativity information an LR parser would parse this as `3 * (4 + 1)` which is of course not correct knowing that multiplication has a higher precednce than addition.  If we inform the parser of the precedence and associativity of the various operators then an LR parser will parse this correctly as `(3 * 4) + 1`.  \n",

That is each row in the precedence table represents a precedence level and the rows are sorted in increasing precendence level.\n"
