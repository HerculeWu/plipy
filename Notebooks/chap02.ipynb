    "5. If *A* is a regular expression then `(`*A*`)` is also a regular expression.  Parentheses allow us to group regular expressions.  If we wanted to have parentheses be part of the regular expression itself we would have to 'escape' them.  That is, `(`*A*`)` is different from `\\(`*A*`\\)`.\n",

    "7. If *A* is a regular expression then *A*`?` is also a regular expression and specifies the regular expression *A* as optional.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The regular expression `[A-Z]` represents a single character between `A` and `Z`.  Similarly for `[a-z]` and `[0-9]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The dot operator is a regular expression that represents any single printable character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The special characters `\\n`, `\\t`, and `\\r` are also regular expressions\n",
    "representing the newline character, the tab character, and the carriage return character, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `^` operator computes the complement of a set.  For example, if we have the regular expression `[abc]` matching either `a`, or `b`, or `c`, then the complement `[^abc]` will match any character other than `a`, `b`, or `c`.  This is useful in\n",

    "1. Define a small LL(1) language using a grammar.  Write the grammar in tuple notation as we did\n",
    "in the section on lookahead sets.  Then use the lookahead set algorithm to compute the grammar extended\n",
    "with the lookahead sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a small left-recursive language.  Write its grammar in tuple notation as we did in the section on lookahead sets.  Convince yourself that the lookahead set algorithm does not work\n",
    "on this grammar. Is it LR(0)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the Exp0 grammar in tuple notation and the top-down parsing algorithm and show that you can parse\n",
    "some non-trivial Exp0 programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. LL(0) parsers are parsers that read input from left to right, construct the left-most derivation but use no lookahead symbols.\n",
    "What does that mean for the kind of grammars such a parser could use for parsing?  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Rewrite the lookahead set algorithm in such a way that it detects left-recursion, issues an error message, and terminates. The extension should be general enough so that it also detects left-recursion in mutually recursive rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We have shown that if-then-else statements create shift-reduce conflicts in LR(0) parsers.  Show that right-recursive rules such as\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  list : item\n",
    "        | item list\n",
    "       \n",
    "  item : e\n",

    "also create a shift-reduce conflict in our LR(0) parser.\n",
    "Compute a trace similar to Figure 6 for the input stream `e e e \\eof`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Design a lexical rule that defines a token for the binary representation of positive integer numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Design a lexical rule defines a token for the floating point numbers (don't include the scientific notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Write the following grammar as a Ply specification (including both lexical and syntax specifications), and parse both correct and incorrect input streams.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  list : [ element_list ]\n",
    "  \n",

    "12. (project) Extend the bottom-up parsing algorithm so that it constructs and returns a parse tree.\n",
    " \n",

    " \n",
    "14. (project) Reduce-reduce conflicts in bottom-up parsers can be resolved by guessing and backtracking: guess one alternative and try to parse the sentence; if this is not possible backtrack to the decision point and try another alternative. Extend the bottom-up parsing algorithm with backtracking on reduce-reduce conflicts and implement a parser using your extended algorithm that reads a grammar  and an input stream and returns `True` if the program in the input stream is a valid sentence in the language of the grammar otherwise `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. (project) Build a recursive descent parser for the Exp0 programming language.  Show that it works by parsing some sentences that are valid in Exp0.  Show that it rejects invalid sentences with syntax errors.\n",
