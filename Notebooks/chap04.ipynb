    "standard programming constructs such as the `jump to label` instruction for instance.  We show that such programming\n",

    "and then use this IR during the actual processing of the program.  We illustrate these ideas with a simple\n",
    "bytecode language (virtual machine).  We continue our discussion with the fact that the *ad hoc* IR design\n",

    "languages.  We then introduce the idea of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) as an intermediate representation\n",
    "and show that this intermediate representation can be directly derived from the grammar itself giving us\n",
    "a more principled way of constructing intermediate representations.\n",
    "We illustrate these ideas with a pretty printer program for a simple high-level language.\n",

    "## Beyond Syntax Directed Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 2 we introduced syntax directed interpretation as a way to add semantics to programming\n",
    "languages.\n",
    "However, this scheme fails when some language construct needs access to information that is not directly computable based on the local syntactic structures or has not been entered into the symbol table for instance.\n",
    "Classic examples of this is the goto-statement in C and the `jump to label`  machine code instruction.\n",
    "In order to examine this a little bit closer we extend our Exp1 language with conditional and unconditional jump instructions\n",
    "and call the new language Exp1bytecode.  \n",
    "This new language is based on our Exp1 language but introduces five new statements: \n",
    "\\begin{description}\n",
    "\\item[{\\icd noop}] -- a statement that does nothing.\n",
    "\\item[{\\icd stop}] -- a statement that halts the execution.\n",
    "\\item[{\\icd jumpT exp label}] -- a statement that evaluates {\\icd exp} and then jumps to the {\\icd label} if the expression evaluates to true.\n",
    "\\item[{\\icd jumpF exp label}] -- a statement that evaluates {\\icd exp} and then jumps to the {\\icd label} if the expression evaluates to false.\n",
    "\\item[{\\icd jump label}] -- an unconditional jump to the {\\icd label}.\n",
    "\\end{description}\n",
    "Recall that in Exp1 expressions are based on integer values.\n",
    "Therefore, in order to compute the truth values necessary for the conditional jump instructions we adopt the following convention: an expression value of zero represents the boolean value false and a non-zero expression value represents the boolean value true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Exp1bytecode language also introduces the idea of labeled statements as targets for jump statements.\n",
    "Labels are names followed by a colon that precede a statement.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\\begin{code}\n",
    "      store x 5;\n",
    "L1:   store x (- x 1);\n",
    "      jumpT x L1;\n",
    "\\end{code}\n",
    "This program loops while {\\icd x} is non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\index{relational operator}\n",
    "In order to write some interesting programs in this new language we also introduce two new operators:\n",
    "\\begin{description}\n",
    "\\item[{\\icd =}] -- the equality relational operator.\n",
    "\\item[{\\icd =<}] -- the less-equal relational operator. \n",
    "\\end{description}\n",
    "Both operators return zero for the boolean value false and one for the boolean value true.\n",

    "they may appear as label references in the jump statements on lines 14 through 16.\n",

    "According to the rule that defines programs as non-empty lists of statements on line 8 we see that label definition may appear \n",

    "\\subsection{An Example: A Bytecode Interpreter}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at Exp1bytecode we can identify three major characteristics of this language:\n",
    "\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "\\item We have variables that hold values and these values can be changed and referenced by instructions.\n",
    "\\item We have conditional and unconditional jumps which use label definitions and references to specify the range of the jumps.\n",
    "\\item Programs in this language consist of a sequence of concrete instructions.\n",
    "\\end{itemize}\n",
    "Given these features of Exp1bytecode and given the fact that the\n",
    "language looks like very abstract machine code  or bytecode one design choice it to make our IR resemble a virtual machine that consists of three\n",
    "major entities:\n",
    "\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "\\item A symbol table to hold variable definitions.\n",
    "\\item A label table to hold label definitions.\n",
    "\\item A container (in the object-oriented sense) to hold a list of instructions, that is, a container that holds our program to be interpreted.\n",
    "\\end{itemize} \n",
    "Figure~\\ref{chap03:exp1bytecode-IR} shows this IR design.\n",
    "Here the abstract machine is shown with the program,\n",
    "\\begin{code}\n",
    "   store x 10 ;\n",
    "L1:\n",
    "   print x ;\n",
    "   store x (- x 1) ;\n",
    "   jumpT x L1 ;\n",
    "   stop ;\n",
    "\\end{code}\n",
    "loaded into its data structures.\n",
    "Given that programs in the IR representation still look very much like the programs in the original textual representation it should follow that \n",
    "the IR is probably easy to construct (which it is as we will see later on).\n",
    "Also, given that programs are represented as a linked list of instructions is should also follow that the programs are easy to interpret -- we simply \n",
    "walk down the list of instructions and execute each one in turn.\n",
    "Again, as we will see later on in an OO environment this is pretty straight forward.\n",
    "So it seems that our IR design fulfills the two key points of IR design we made above: easy to construct and easy to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us just think through the issue with labels that we had before when we attempted a syntax directed approach to the interpretation \n",
    "of Exp1bytecode.\n",
    "In our IR design labels behave much like variables in the sense that you have a definition point and you have label references.\n",
    "In order to deal with this effectively our IR uses a label table that records the instructions that act as definition points for particular labels.\n",
    "In our example in Figure~\\ref{chap03:exp1bytecode-IR} we see that the label table holds the label {\\icd L1} and the entry \n",
    "for this label points to the definition point of this label, namely the print statement in the program.\n",
    "Label references point back to the label table and therefore we can find and resolve the targets for any jumps that occur in a program.\n",
    "Also note that forward references are no longer a problem because the separate syntax analysis phase will have seen all label\n",
    "definition points and entered them into the label table before the semantic phase started.\n",

    "The most striking thing about this class is that all its members are static members, that is, the class itself really just acts as a container for all the\n",
    "data structures of our interpreter.\n",
    "On lines 7 through 9 we see the declaration of our IR and on lines 12 through 15 we see the declaration of our lexer and parser objects together\n",
    "with their appropriate input streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top-level class also contains the static main function that is the entry point for the interpreter.\n",
    "The layout of this function is slightly different from the layout of the main functions we encountered in the previous chapter.\n",
    "Here we are embedding the code in a try-catch block because now the syntax as well as the semantic phase can generate errors and the\n",
    "most convenient way to deal with these is as exceptions.\n",
