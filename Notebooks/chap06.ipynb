    "The big difference between interpereters and compilers is that compilers have the ability to think about how to translate a source program into target code in the most effective way.  Usually that means trying to translate the program in such a way that it executes as fast as possible on the target machine.  Interpreters on the other hand are typically machine-agnostic in the sense that they do not try to optimize the program in any way but just execute it as we saw in Chapter 5 when we constructed the Cuppa1 interpreter.  Here we take a look at two optimizations our Cuppa1 compiler can perform in order to improve the generated code."

However, in conjunction with *constant propagation* and *dead code elimination*, constant folding can become quite powerful and useful.  Constant propogation is a program analysis technique that looks at variables in expressions to see if in fact they act like constants.  In dead code elimination code is defined as dead if it has no consequence on the execution of the program and the optimization removes this code to make target programs smaller and more efficient.  Consider the following code,\n",

That means similar to code generation we need to walk the AST and look for patterns that allow us to rewrite the tree.\n"
